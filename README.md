# Vowel-Cepstrum-Analysis
This is an assignment of the course Advanced Signal Processing (AUTh-8th semester-2020)

The purpose of this project is to transfer the recorded vowels from the time to the cepstrum domain, filter them appropriately, extract the impulse response and recreate the sound. For further details, the assignment's instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/vassomak/Vowel-Cepstrum-Analysis/blob/main/PTES_2020_ex4.pdf).

For processing each vowel, 10 files were created, named
'maleXXX.m' and 'femXXX.m', where X is the corresponding vowel, in each of which
vowelProcess.m is called. At the end of each such file, one new audio file is created
with the reconstructed vowel.
